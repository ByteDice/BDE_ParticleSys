# BDE_ParticleSys

BDE_ParticleSys is a highly customizable **server-side** particle system that uses `Block Display Entities` (BDEs) as particles. It is meant to be used as a library for other mods, but can be used as a standalone mod too.

If BDE_ParticleSys is used as a standalone mod, you will only be able to use it with the custom in-game commands `/GiveEmitterTool`, `/KillAllEmitters`, and `/ManageEmitters`. Any particles made, removed, or changed with those commands are **temporary** and get reverted once the server shuts down, as they are meant for quick testing.

### In-game commands (does not save):
* `/GiveEmitterTool`
* `/SpawnEmitter`
* `/KillAllEmitters`
* `/ManageEmitters`
* `GlobalMaxParticles` (GameRule)
* `ShowParticleDebug` (GameRule)
