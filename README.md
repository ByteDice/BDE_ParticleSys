# BDE_ParticleSys

BDE_ParticleSys is a highly customizable **server-side** particle system that uses `Block Display Entities` (BDEs) as particles. It is meant to be used as a library for other mods, but can be used as a standalone mod too.

<!-- change GiveParticleEmitter to GiveEmitterTool -->
If BDE_ParticleSys is used as a standalone mod, you will only be able to use it with the custom in-game commands `/GiveParticleEmitter` and `/ManageEmitters`. Any particles made with those commands are **temporary** and get **removed** once the server shuts down.
